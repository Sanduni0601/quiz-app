- **Timer**: A countdown timer is shown for each question.
- **Question Progression**: The questions progress after answering correctly.
- **Money Pyramid**: Displays the money the user has earned based on their progress in the game.
- **Result Screen**: Shows the user's total earnings at the end of the game.
